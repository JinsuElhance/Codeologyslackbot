# Codeologyslackbot
A Slack-bot to help the Codeology officer team curb the amount of time spent on logistics and contacting members so that we can focus on the features of the club that deserve our effort and attention while allowing for clear and reliable communications with members. 

### Currently working on:
- Change params for non-admin excuse request to not be so awkward (expect 4 args)
